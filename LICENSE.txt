 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble
9
​
10
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
11
software and other kinds of works.
12
​
13
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
14
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
15
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
16
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
17
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
18
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
19
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
20
your programs, too.
21
​
22
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
23
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
24
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
25
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
26
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
27
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
28
​
29
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
30
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
31
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
32
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
33
​
34
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
35
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
36
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
37
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
38
know their rights.
39
​
40
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
41
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
42
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
43
​
44
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
45
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
46
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
47
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
48
authors of previous versions.
